            This was a staple for me in college- easy to dump in the crockpot in the morning and almost ready by the time you get home- and if you use crockpot liners, then clean up is even easier! It was also warm and comforting on rainy pacific northwest nights. It's a flexible recipe and things can easily be omitted or added depending on taste. Want super spicy salsa chicken? Go for it! Want some beans and corn? Throw 'em right in.
